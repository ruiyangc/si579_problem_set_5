## SI 579 001 WN 2021 Problem Set 5 - Integrating 3rd Party Libraries

For this assignment, you will get practice integrating JavaScript libraries. You can continue using the code you wrote for problem set 4 or you can create a new website for this assignment.

### Requirements:

1. You must integrate at least one 3rd-party JavaScript library into your page. In your assignment's JavaScript file, please indicate what library you used and how you used it. You can use any library you want but here are some initial suggestions:

* Lodash (Links to an external site.) - contains many low-level utilities and useful functions
* Moment.js (Links to an external site.) - makes it easier to work with dates and times
* Snap SVG (Links to an external site.) - allows you to create custom vector-based drawings (which can also be interactive)
* D3 (Links to an external site.) - for creating custom data visualizations

1. After integrating your library, you must do one of:

    1. Integrate a CSS framework to make your page look nicer. For example, you might consider:
    * Bootstrap (Links to an external site.) - makes it easier to create grid-based layouts (among other things)
    * FontAwesome (Links to an external site.) - a set of icons that are free to use (there is also a paid version but the free version is very capable)
    1. Integrate another JavaScrpit library (so two in total)

Here is an example of a site that would satisfy these requirements: https://soney.github.io/si-579/hw5
